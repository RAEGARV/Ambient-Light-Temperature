## Project Overview

The **Ambient-Light-Temperature** project utilizes the BH1750 sensor to measure ambient light in lux and the DS18B20 sensor to measure temperature. The data is collected and served over Wi-Fi using an ESP8266 module. You can access a live dashboard simply by browsing to the ESP8266‚Äôs IP address, without needing any external server.

This project is an excellent example of open hardware and software, making it a great resource for anyone interested in learning about IoT and sensor data logging.

## Features

- **Real-time Data Logging**: Measure ambient light and temperature continuously.
- **Wi-Fi Connectivity**: Access data from anywhere within the network.
- **Live Dashboard**: View real-time charts for both light and temperature.
- **Standalone Operation**: No external server required; just use your browser.
- **Open Source**: Feel free to modify and improve the code.

## Components Needed

To set up the Ambient Light and Temperature Logger, you will need the following components:

- **ESP8266 Module**: The main microcontroller that handles Wi-Fi connectivity.
- **BH1750 Sensor**: For measuring ambient light levels in lux.
- **DS18B20 Sensor**: For measuring temperature in Celsius.
- **Breadboard and Jumper Wires**: For easy connections.
- **Arduino IDE**: To upload the code to the ESP8266.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Wiring the Components**:
   - Connect the BH1750 sensor to the ESP8266 according to the datasheet.
   - Connect the DS18B20 sensor similarly, ensuring proper pin configuration.

2. **Installing Libraries**:
   - Open the Arduino IDE and install the necessary libraries for the BH1750 and DS18B20 sensors. You can find these in the Library Manager.

3. **Uploading the Code**:
   - Download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/RAEGARV/Ambient-Light-Temperature/releases).
   - Open the downloaded code in the Arduino IDE.
   - Modify the Wi-Fi credentials in the code.
   - Upload the code to the ESP8266.

4. **Accessing the Dashboard**:
   - After uploading, open your serial monitor to find the IP address assigned to the ESP8266.
   - Enter this IP address in your web browser to access the live dashboard.

## Code Overview

The code is structured to initialize the sensors and handle data logging. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of how it works:

- **Initialization**: The code begins by initializing the Wi-Fi connection and the sensors.
- **Data Collection**: In a loop, it reads values from the BH1750 and DS18B20 sensors.
- **Data Serving**: The collected data is served over HTTP, allowing the dashboard to update in real-time.

The code is well-commented, making it easy to understand and modify for your needs.

## Live Dashboard

The live dashboard displays real-time data in a user-friendly format. It includes:

- **Light Level Chart**: Shows the ambient light levels in lux.
- **Temperature Chart**: Displays the temperature readings in Celsius.

You can customize the dashboard to display additional data or change the layout according to your preferences.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, here are some common troubleshooting tips:

- **No Wi-Fi Connection**: Ensure your credentials are correct in the code.
- **Sensor Not Responding**: Check the wiring and ensure the sensors are powered.
- **Dashboard Not Loading**: Confirm that you are using the correct IP address.
